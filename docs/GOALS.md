# Project Goals: Automated Release Notes GitHub Action

## Purpose
Automate the generation of clean, well-structured release notes for every GitHub release, reducing manual effort and improving consistency.

## Key Objectives

1. **Automated Release Notes Generation**
   - Parse merged pull requests, closed issues, and commit messages since the last release/tag.
   - Categorize changes into configurable sections (e.g., Features, Fixes, Breaking Changes).
   - Format output in Markdown for easy readability.

2. **Integration with GitHub Releases**
   - Post generated release notes directly to the GitHub Releases page on push to main/tagged release.
   - Optionally output release notes as an artifact or save to a file in the repository.

3. **Configurability**
   - Allow users to customize section headers and output format via config file or workflow inputs.
   - Support additional sections as needed (e.g., Documentation, Refactoring).

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Provide clear documentation and examples for setup and usage.
   - Maintain a modular codebase with comprehensive tests.
   - Enable easy contribution and extension of features.

5. **Reliability and Maintainability**
   - Ensure robust error handling and informative logging.
   - Maintain compatibility with GitHub Actions best practices and API changes.
